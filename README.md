This is my first Django project.

I am currently learning the Python Web framework, Django, from a pdf tutorial called Tango With Django.


#### Run this on Local
To run this on your local machine you will need:

Python3
`brew install python3`

Pip3
`brew install pip3`

In terminal:
`$ pip3 install -U django==1.9.10`
`$ pip3 install pillow`

`$ python3`
```
>>> import django
>>> django.get_version()
'1.9.10'
>>> exit()
```

### To Run the Application
`$ python3 manage.py runserver`

Go to you `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser!
